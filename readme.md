# Prject Weather App

## Prject description
Create a Weather App that allows users to check the current weather conditions of any location. Users can enter a city or a zip code,
and the application will display the current temperature, weather description, humidity,
and wind speed for that location. The application will utilize JavaScript for frontend logic and fetch weather data from a public API.

## Project Requirements
### 1. Front-end:
- Create an HTML file (index.html) with input fields for users to enter the location.
- Use a CSS file (styles.css) for styling the Weather App interface.
- Implement frontend logic in a JavaScript file (script.js) to handle user input, fetch weather data from the API, and display the weather information on the webpage.
### 2. API Integration:
- Use a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack) to fetch weather data based on the user's input.
- Make AJAX requests to the API to retrieve weather information.
### 3. Functionality:
        - Users can enter a city name or a zip code.
        - The application fetches weather data from the API based on the user's input.
        - Display the current temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed for the specified location.

## Deliverables:

### 1. Frontend Files:
    - HTML File (index.html): Contains the structure of the webpage with input fields and weather information display area.
    - CSS File (styles.css): Provides styling for the Weather App interface.
    - JavaScript File (script.js): Implements the logic of the Weather App, including handling user input, fetching weather data from the API, and updating the webpage with weather information.

## Example Tasks:
### 1. Set Up HTML Structure:
        - Create an HTML file (index.html) with input fields for users to enter the location and a display area for weather information.
### 2. Implement CSS Styling
        -  Use a CSS file (styles.css) to style the Weather App interface, including input fields, buttons, and weather information display area.
### 3. Fetch Weather Data:
       - Write JavaScript code in script.js to handle user input and make AJAX requests to the weather API to fetch weather data based on the user's input.
### 4. Display Weather Information:
        - Parse the weather data retrieved from the API response and display the current temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed for the specified location on the webpage.
### 5. Test and Debug:
      - Test the Weather App by entering different locations and verifying that the weather information is displayed correctly.
      - Debug any errors or issues that arise during testing.

###  6. Deployment:
        - Donâ€™t forget to deploy the project to GitHub Pages.
